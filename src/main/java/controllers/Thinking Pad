what do i need to do to make the recipes work?

1 I need to have managed directories, and i need the user to be able to assign mutiple recipes to each directory.

Solution: upon adding a managed Directory create a new directory object, this object and have an ArrayList that can have
recipes added to it. I will have a timer that runs a function that checks each directory object and check that objects
trigger conditions

2 I need to be able to create new recipes and store them, and then assign them to a directory.

Solution: I can have a menu that creates a Map with the recipe name, and the functions that need called

3 I need to be able to loop through all the managed directories and check to see if any recipes need triggered
