This section describes Condition Action Design.

Condition Action is where you define a condition and if that condition is is satisfied an action takes place.


what follows will be my musings on how this might best be accomplished.


I think that the best way to do this is to break actions and conditions down into the smallest possible actions and then
figure out how to chain these actions to accomplish the desired effect.

Lets start with file movement. and it's triggers.

first we will start with time based triggers. what kind of timed based triggers would be useful to people.

perhaps the most obvious action would be for the files of a folder to be moved after a certain period of time passes

Lets lay out the steps for this to take place.

1) establish a managed directory.
2) create the ability for each directory to have Actions and triggers applied to them.
3) track the triggers and actions such that they are executed when they need to be. this is an interesting problem and one im not sure how best to tackle
the problem.


1.2) let's break down these steps into smaller steps

the first step is more or less done, providing I don't need to modify it to accommodate later code.

2.2) Step 2 I think will best be added into the Directory blue print.  I will likely have to write an "actions file" with all the different methods
that can possibly be carried out then perhaps create a hashSet of calls to these methods. for each of the directories in the managed directories
hashset I will run some code that checks that directories triggers and if the conditions of that directories triggers are satisfied it will execute it.

3.2) my idea in 2.2 may actually take care of this step!


Note- I have decided that the action trigger patterns need to be objects unto themselves that way they can be saved and reapplied to other places
they are needed as the user sees fit.
