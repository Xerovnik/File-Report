# File-Report
 
File Report is a File / Directory manager that provides the user with a great degree of control over the managed directories Via allowing the automation of certain predefined actions to be performed on these files and directories. An example of this might be that files that are downloaded from the internet are automatically moved to a certain folder based on its file type, or Files from one folder get moved to another if they have not been accessed in the recent past.<br><br>

 
 It also provides the user with a great deal of information about the files in the managed directories.<br><br>
